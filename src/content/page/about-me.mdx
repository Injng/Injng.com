I'm a high school student passionate about computer science. Join me in having fun through recreational programming!

#### Random quotes that I find insightful:
> The thing about the world is that it doesn't have any extra pieces. It's like pi: it contains everything. You remove a single piece, no circle. Your recklessness, your mistakes, are the reason why when they say, 'You can't change the world,' you won't listen.

-- Harold Finch in _Person of Interest_, "2πr"

> 有时候，
我们明明知道前面的道路布满荆棘，
却还一往无前。
不是我们无惧伤痛，
而是我们坚信：
只有一路向前，才不会错过最美的风景。

-- 《创想季》
