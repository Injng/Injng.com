The entire narrative is at
 [Day 1 of AoC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1), but in essence
we are tasked with decoding a file with obfuscated values. Each line of the
file has a value we need to extract, and the answer is the sum of all of
these values.

The correct value for each line is the first and last numeric digit in that
line. For example, the line `tr3b2c4et` has a value of 34, and the line 
`tr4e` has a value of 44.

## Implementation
This problem boils down to how we can find the first and last numbers in 
a string. The simplest way to do this is to have two for loops, one starting
from the beginning and incrementing, and one starting from the end and
decrementing. Each for loop will break once it hits a number.

The question, then, is how do we know that a string is a number? We can do
this through the `tryParse` function, defined for the `int` class. More 
specifically, given a string `str`, `int.tryParse(str)` will return an int
if `str` is an integer, otherwise it will return null. Therefore, we know
a character is an integer if passing it through this method results in a
non-null value.

```dart
// final calibration value
int calibration = 0;

// search from the beginning for first number
for (int i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
    int? value = int.tryParse(text[i]);
    if (value != null) {
        calibration += 10 * value;
        break;
    }
}
```

Here we see the first for loop. Notice that since there is a possibility
that `value` is null, we have to define it with the `int?` type to reflect
that.

Now, to tackle the problem of reading input. We can read input from a file
by using dart's `dart:io` package along with the `File` object:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

final file = File('day1.in');
int values = 0;
List<String> lines = file.readAsLinesSync();
```

This reads the lines from the file called `day1.in`, which is our input file.
These lines are read into a `List<String>`. If we wrap our previous logic
in a function, then loop over each line, we get our final code:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

int getValues(String text) {
    // final calibration value
    int calibration = 0;

    // search from the beginning for first number
    for (int i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
        int? value = int.tryParse(text[i]);
        if (value != null) {
            calibration += 10 * value;
            break;
        }
    }

    // search from the end for first number
    for (int i = text.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int? value = int.tryParse(text[i]);
        if (value != null) {
            calibration += value;
            break;
        }
    }

    return calibration;
}

void main() {
    final file = File('day1.in');
    int values = 0;
    List<String> lines = file.readAsLinesSync();

    for (String line in lines) {
        values += getValues(line);
    }

    print(values);
}
```
