Continuing with our journey with genetic algorithms, let's create a game to run our algorithms
upon. This is gonna be a really contrived example, but it's fine -- recreational programming
doens't have to be useful!

To begin, we can imagine a board with cells, and entities that live within the cells. These entities
can be in two different states: moving, or fighting. Entities move on each turn, and if more than one
entity occupy the same cell, they will fight until only one remains.

## Encoding Behavior
We want each entity to have different behavior. In the future, we will modify (mutate) this behavior
in generations, making each generation of entities better (hopefully) than the last. We encode 
this behavior in a struct called `Chromosome`:

```rs
pub struct Chromosome {
    pub strength: u32,
    pub aggressive: u32,
    pub agility: u32,
}
```

Here, we see that we have three `u32` values to work with: the strength of an entity, how aggressive
it is, and how agile it is.

# Movement
The first step in each turn of this game is that the entities *move*. Movement is based upon two
genes: `aggressive` and `agility`. How aggressive the entity is determines where it moves: the more
aggressive it is, the more likely it is to purposely move *towards* another entity. The agility of
an entity directly determines the speed of the entity.

In order to determine where the entity should move, we first determine the distances on each cell of
the board to the nearest entity:

```rs
pub fn get_distances(cells: &mut [[Cell; COLS as usize]; ROWS as usize]) -> [[f32; COLS as usize]; ROWS as usize] {
    let mut distances: [[f32; COLS as usize]; ROWS as usize] = [[MAX as f32; COLS as usize]; ROWS as usize];
    for i in 0..ROWS {
        for j in 0..COLS {
            if !cells[i as usize][j as usize].entities.is_empty() {
                for k in 0..ROWS {
                    for l in 0..COLS {
                        let distance = ((i as i32 - k as i32).pow(2) + (j as i32 - l as i32).pow(2)) as f32;
                        if distance < distances[k as usize][l as usize] {
                            distances[k as usize][l as usize] = distance;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    distances
}
```

While this set of four nested for loops may not be the most efficient, it is good enough for our
needs. Next, we can implement a movement method for each entity, using weighted randomness to
determine the direction:

```rs
impl Entity {
    /* -- snip -- */

    // move left, right, up, and down depending on aggressiveness and agility
    pub fn move_entity(&mut self, distances: &[[f32; COLS as usize]; ROWS as usize], agile: bool) {
        // order the cells by distance in increasing order
        let mut cells: Vec<Cell> = Vec::new();
        if self.x > 0 {
            cells.push(Cell { x: self.x - 1, y: self.y, entities: Vec::new() });
        }
        if self.x < COLS - 1 {
            cells.push(Cell { x: self.x + 1, y: self.y, entities: Vec::new() });
        }
        if self.y > 0 {
            cells.push(Cell { x: self.x, y: self.y - 1, entities: Vec::new() });
        }
        if self.y < ROWS - 1 {
            cells.push(Cell { x: self.x, y: self.y + 1, entities: Vec::new() });
        }
        cells.sort_by(|a, b| {
            let distance_a = distances[a.y as usize][a.x as usize];
            let distance_b = distances[b.y as usize][b.x as usize];
            distance_a.partial_cmp(&distance_b).unwrap()
        });

        // if less than 4 cells in vector, pad to 4 with last cell
        while cells.len() < 4 {
            cells.push(cells[cells.len() - 1].clone());
        }

        // move to the closest cell with a probability based on aggressiveness
        let bounds = Uniform::from(0..100);
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        let first = bounds.sample(&mut rng);
        let second = bounds.sample(&mut rng);
        let third = bounds.sample(&mut rng);
        if first < self.chromosome.aggressive {
            self.x = cells[0].x;
            self.y = cells[0].y;
        } else if second < self.chromosome.aggressive {
            self.x = cells[1].x;
            self.y = cells[1].y;
        } else if third < self.chromosome.aggressive {
            self.x = cells[2].x;
            self.y = cells[2].y;
        } else {
            self.x = cells[3].x;
            self.y = cells[3].y;
        }

        // if agility is greater than 50, move again without recalculating distances
        if agile && self.chromosome.agility > 50 {
            self.move_entity(&distances, false);
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that a high agility allows the entity to run the move method again, essentially moving
twice in the same game turn.

## Fighting
When more than one entity occupies the same cell on the grid, the winner is determined by 
whichever entity has the higher `strength` gene. If two entities have the same strength,
randomness is used to determine the winner:

```rs
for i in 0..ROWS {
    for j in 0..COLS {
        let cell = &mut cells[i as usize][j as usize];

        // exit early if no conflicting entities in cell
        if cell.entities.len() < 2 {
            continue;
        }

        // make the strongest entity win
        let mut strongest: &Entity = &cell.entities[0];
        for entity in &cell.entities {
            if entity.chromosome.strength > strongest.chromosome.strength {
                strongest = entity;
            } else if entity.chromosome.strength == strongest.chromosome.strength {
                let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                let winner = rng.gen_range(0..2);
                if winner == 1 { strongest = entity; }
            }
        }
        cell.entities = vec![*strongest];
    }
}
```

Next time, we'll start looking into how we can begin mutating these entities to create
some simulated evolution!
