The past few days I've been exeprimenting with **Project IDX**, a up and coming IDE developed
by Google, based on VSCode but runs on Google's Cloud Workstations so you can access an entire
environment from the web. Generally I'm wary about using proprietary tools (go neovim and 
vscodium!!), but as I was genuinely interested in what Google could come up with (and because
Google already has my data + Microsoft already has all my code through GitHub) I signed myself
up for the waitlist.

Upon looking through what IDX had to offer, I stumbled across **Flutter**: a cross-platform
app development framework. I'd heard about it in the past, but this time I was motivated to dig
a little deeper.

I've never touched app development, especially for mobile platforms, so I thought I could do
some learning here and engage in some recreational development! So, here we are, on the
*road-to-flutter*.

## Hello, Dart!
Flutter happens to be based on the language known as **Dart**. Therefore, in order
to get good at Flutter, one needs to get good at Dart. Thus, after looking through a primer
at [Learn dart in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/dart/), I was ready to tackle
some programming on my own.

First up was, of course, the classic *hello world* program. To make things easier, I decided
to use [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev), a browser-based Dart playground. To print to stdout, one
uses the `print` function:

```dart
void main() {
  print("Hello, world!");
}
```

This is among the easiest of the C-style languages I've had experience with to print something
out. However, you could add a variable for more extensibility:

```dart
void main() {
  var name = "Dart"; // or perhaps const NAME
  print("Hello, ${name}!");
}
```

Here, string interpolation was used by using `${}` with the variable name between the brackets.
It is also useful to note that string concatenation can be achieved by just placing strings
next to each other, no operator needed.

Next time, I would love to try out some Advent of Code problems (another stepping stone on my
classic path to programming language familiarity)!
